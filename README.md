# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction (End-to-End Machine Learning Project)

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.  
This project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline â€” from data preprocessing and model training to interactive deployment using Streamlit.

## ðŸ§­ Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most iconic datasets in data science.  
This project builds a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a passenger's survival based on features such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)  
- Fare  
- Number of Siblings/Spouses (`SibSp`)  
- Number of Parents/Children (`Parch`)  
- Embarked Port
